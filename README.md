One script file per chapter of the textbook, as indicated in the filename.

All code in textbook (1st edition) was up-to-date as of July 2020. This code relies heavily on R and Bioconductor, which are pretty dynamically updated, and so this repository enables the book's codebase to be kept up-to-date. All explanations in the book should still be valid, but if any part of the code needs to be substantially altered I will highlight this with a comment in the corresponding script file.
